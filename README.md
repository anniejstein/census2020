# census2020
Website to inform community members about the Census 2020


Census 2020 Kiosks Project!

We need a team of people to assist the city of San Jose and Santa Clara County with an outreach project surrounding the 2020 Census. The goal is increase participation by creating a website that explains why and how to fill out the 2020 Census, and link to the Federal Census site.

This website will be made available through kiosks at community centers and libraries, as well as online. The content will be text and videos answering questions and concerns about the census.

We need a simple, robust design with an efficient and attractive interface that meets ADA accessibilty guidelines. It should also allow easy navigation to the translated content (provided by the city).

We think we need team members with the following skills:
- User Interface and User Experience Design
- Copywriting/Marketing
- Media Design/Video Creation
- Community Outreach
- Javascript/HTML/Responsive Design
- Usability Testing
- Site Analytics
